* Find the list of companies based on the number of full time employees.  This should use the keyword `find_between_years`
    `e.g. find_between 1,001-5,000`

  should find_between_years be find_employees_between

  Things I would do differently: 

  1. use a switch statemeint to handle the different commands instead of if/else control.
